# ModularConstruction

Developed with Unreal Engine 4.23

4.25.1 has bugs, noice! 

The game idea works like this:
        1. Customers request specific houses with certain features for example Kitchen, a room with table in the center
        2. You then have to make rooms that fit to the houses, you have to think of the waterpipe,   electricity 
        connection, and is just like a puzzle game.  The sink have to attach to waterpipe, lightning have to attach to the 
        circuit etc
        3.  You then can have a factory that built preexisting rooms that you design, so it can help on your future quests

Rules:
              1. Earn money by completing request, you will lose money if you fail a customer request 
              2. Use the money to expand your shop, upgrade your tool sets, upgrade your factory, 
              unlock features etc
              3. Complete all level to finish the game! Or Continue forever and expands your factory and continue up! :p
For a tiny bit of the inspiration:
               This is what I think how the future construction will be like. Instead of buying a house. You buy a land then you choose how to house should look like and group all the housing together.
